**(a)** 
x = 0.25, y=0.3.
	The similarity matrix is expected to be block-diagonal for well-separated clusters, this implies that the items within a cluster have high similarity values and low similarity values with items in other clusters.

**(b)** 

The MAX or complete link clustering method calculates the inter-cluster distance as the maximum distance between points in different clusters. Mathematically, the distance between two clusters \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) is given by:

\[
d(C_1, C_2) = \max_{x \in C_1, y \in C_2} d(x, y)
\]


Given the clusters \(C_1 = \{P1, P3\}\) and \(C_2 = \{P2, P4\}\), we want to find the maximum distance between any point in \(C_1\) and any point in \(C_2\).

- Distance between \(P1\) (from \(C_1\)) and \(P2\) (from \(C_2\)) is \(1 - 0.6 = 0.4\).
- Distance between \(P1\) (from \(C_1\)) and \(P4\) (from \(C_2\)) is \(1 - 0.3 = 0.7\).
- Distance between \(P3\) (from \(C_1\)) and \(P2\) (from \(C_2\)) is \(1 - 0.1 = 0.9\).
- Distance between \(P3\) (from \(C_1\)) and \(P4\) (from \(C_2\)) is \(1 - 0.79 = 0.21\).

Using the complete link method, the inter-cluster distance is the maximum of these distances, which is \(0.9\).
